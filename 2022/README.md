Here are my solutions for the Advent of Code 2022 challenge!

This year I used the AOC as an incitation to learn the Rust language.

I'm a very beginner in Rust, so you're warned, most of my code is ugly.


Now that the challenge is over, I will try to do a second pass on my code, to improve the Rust aspects.
